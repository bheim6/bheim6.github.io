  <h2>Dirty Signals</h2>
  <p>August 10, 2016</p>
  <p>Which pedal is right for you?</p>
<p>Overdrive, Distortion, or Fuzz</p>

<p>When choosing a pedal to add grit and crunch to your guitar sound,
there are many options to choose from, and they all affect the signal
of your instrument by adding in either "soft" or "hard" clipping
to the signal, making it sound distorted. Figure 1 shows a representation
of the audio signal under these conditions.</p>

<p>OVERDRIVE</p>
<p>Overdrive pedals typically fall under the category of "soft-clipping" devices.
This means that they will not fully distort and radically change the nature of the raw audio signal
and are used more as a device to push a tube-powered amplifier further into distortion or "overdrive" it.</p>
<p>The most famous overdrive pedal is the Ibanez Tube Screamer. Used by countless musicians
from Stevie Ray Vaughn to Santana to Metallica, it allowed them to push their tube amps to new levels of dirt
and distortion. The TS808, which was produced from 1979-1981 is particularly interesting, as it was one of the first pedals to rely option
the JRC4558D IC chip, rather than transistors alone to achieve its sound.</p>

<p>DISTORTION</p>
<p>Unlike Overdrives, Distortion pedals are made to alter the guitar signal, regardless of amp level.
They work by using a network of transistors and clipping diodes, to both boost the signal and alter the waveform.
Distortions generate a higher degree of gain and produce a "heavier" sound, but do this at the cost of some integrity
of the original guitar signal.</p>
<p>The Boss DS-1 is a classic pedal used by shredders such as Steve Vai, as well as popular punk rockers Green Day. It is inexpensive, very versatile and
easy to modify, making it a popular choice for musicians on any budget.</p>

<p>FUZZ</p>
<p>Fuzzes are the original dirt boxes, and were some of the first transistorized effects pedals back in the 1960s.
Used by the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Neil Young, and newer artists like Jack White and the Black Keys' Dan Auerbach, fuzzes
create a totally unique flavor of distortion. Splattery, glitchy, roaring, smooth, velcro-rip, and "wall-of-sound" have all been
used to describe the tone that a fuzz produces.</p>
<p>The Arbiter/England Fuzz Face is the grandaddy of all fuzzes. First produced in 1966, this fuzz box used hand-picked Germanium transistors
to create its particular sound. It became so popular because of Jimi Hendrix. The Fuzz Face was Jimi's dirt box of choice throughout his short
but legendary career, it resonated with his chaotic, yet refined and complex playing style. Many modern fuzzes opt for silicon
over germanium because they are far more reliable and less temperamental than their germanium ancestors.</p>

<p>So which style of dirt is right for you?</p>
<p>That all depends on your musical tastes and your gear. Overdrive preserves the natural tone of your guitar and amp. However, it will only be
useful if you have a tube amp, otherwise it will not sound good at all. Distortion can be used with both tube and solid-state amps, and has a wide
tonal spectrum, from overdrive-like sounds up to metal sorcery. Fuzzes are my personal favorite, they are like overdrives in that they are best used with tube-amps,
but can also be used with solid-state effectively when dialed-in properly.</p>
<p>My best advice is to look up what your favorite artist plays, and then explore from there!</p>
